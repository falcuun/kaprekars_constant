# kaprekars_constant

Coding practice. 

"Kaprekar constant, or 6174, is a constant that arises when we take a 4-digit integer,
form the largest and smallest numbers from its digits, and then subtract these two numbers.
Continuing with this process of forming and subtracting, we will always arrive at the number 6174"

Limitation being that the number cannot be made out of 4 same digits.
